# Code Dev Settings

These are settings I have setup for various different environments


## > terminal

  This directory contains JSON files with the settings I use with Windows Terminal


## > vscode

  This directory contains all my VS Code related settings. Alternatively, one could use settings sync
  to sync between multiple instances easily. However, this allows settings to be shared with friends
  or coworkers without having to use my login info.

  ### settings

  These JSON files can be added to settings.json for your vscode environment

  ### extensions

  This directory contains a file with all the extensions I use on my vs code. This file can be executed
  install all extensions. (in a Linux environment)
