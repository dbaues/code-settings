# Code Dev Settings

These are settings I have setup for various different environments


## > terminal

This directory contains JSON files with the settings I use with Windows Terminal


## > vscode

This directory contains all my VS Code related settings. Alternatively, one could use settings sync
to sync between multiple instances easily. However, this allows settings to be shared with friends
or coworkers without having to use my login info.
